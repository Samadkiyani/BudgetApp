Budget Tracker Dashboard - Built with Python & Google Colab
As FinTech students, we often feel overshadowed by Computer Science students, believing we canâ€™t match their technical skills. But the reality is, while we may not compete with them in coding expertise, we bring something equally powerful to the tableâ€”our ability to integrate finance, data analytics, and technology to solve real-world problems.
This isnâ€™t some big projectâ€”itâ€™s just an assignment, a small step in a long journey of learning. But even with this, weâ€™ve managed to develop something meaningful. Presenting the Budget Tracker Dashboard, built using Python and Google Colab, with the incredible guidance of Dr. Usama Arshad.
ðŸ”¹ What This Dashboard Does
âœ… Records Transactions â€“ Add income and expenses with Customer ID
 âœ… Manages Financial Data â€“ Delete records using Customer ID or Name
 âœ… Displays Transaction History â€“ View structured financial data in a table format
 âœ… Tracks Total Income & Expenses â€“ Helps in understanding financial health
 âœ… Visualizes Spending Patterns â€“ Graphical breakdown of expenses by category
 âœ… Monitors Budget Utilization â€“ See how well budgets are being managed per customer
 âœ… Analyzes Income vs. Expense Trends â€“ Interactive charts to track financial patterns
 âœ… Exports Data in CSV Format â€“ Download transaction history for offline analysis
ðŸ’¡ Why This Matters
This assignment might not be a groundbreaking project, but it highlights something crucialâ€”FinTech students are capable of building real-world applications. We might not be as technically strong as CS students, but we understand financial systems, data insights, and industry needs in ways they donâ€™t. Technology alone isnâ€™t enoughâ€”understanding finance is what makes FinTech powerful.
A huge shoutout to Dr. Usama Arshad, whose guidance in Python and financial analytics has been instrumental in helping us move forward. This is just a small step, but with dedication and continuous learning, we can push the boundaries of FinTech innovation.
